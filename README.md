# Navbars

Introduction   :
The goal of this project is to provide a basic example of how to create a navigation bar using HTML and CSS. The navigation bar is designed to be simple and easy to use, with links to different pages on the website.


description :  For each of the websites (Flipkart, Spotify, TCS, Zee5, Myntra, and Hotstar), describe the navigation bar design in detail. Explain the various features of the navigation bar, such as the menu items, submenus, drop-down menus, icons, etc. Use screenshots or illustrations to visually demonstrate the design of each navigation bar.

Design Considerations: Provide insights into the design considerations that were taken into account while designing the navigation bars. Explain how the design choices were made, such as the use of typography, color schemes, contrast, etc. This will give readers an idea of the design process and the reasoning behind the final design.

Features      :
The navigation bar includes the following features:

Responsive design that adjusts to different screen sizes
Links to different pages on the website
Simple and clean design that can be customized to match your website's theme


Usage        :
To customize the navigation bar, you can edit the CSS file (style.css). You can change the colors, fonts, and other styling properties to match the design of your website.
